@report{report-example,
	title = {Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees: A New Tool for Path Planning},
	shorttitle = {Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees},
	abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree ({RRT}) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, {RRTs} are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An {RRT} is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of {RRTs} are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied {RRTs} to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},
